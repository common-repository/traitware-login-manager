The TraitWare plugin combined with its mobile app ensures a simple, secure login to the WordPress Dashboard and Protected Resources via web browsers by replacing usernames and passwords with a QR scan.

== Description ==
The TraitWare plugin combined with its mobile app provides a simple, secure login to the WordPress Dashboard and Protected Resources via web browsers by replacing usernames/passwords with a QR scan. Using the TraitWare mobile app, role-based Multi-Factor (2FA) Authentication provides an extra layer of security to your sign in process. To take full advantage of this feature, a simple setting has been added to disable the username and password fields!

Site administrators can set up the plugin to protect wp-admin/Dashboard logins, Custom page/site user logins, pages, and resources within a page. They can also allow for user to self-register with TraitWare to access resources or their page. Site logins can be accessed with the scan of one QR <a href="https://login.traitware.com/"> here</a>.

TraitWare is a premiere multi-factor authentication platform that never needs a password or a password manager. With our QR web browser login solution, we can also eliminate the need for a username. Not only is our software convenient and easy to use, but it virtually eliminates vulnerabilities associated with traditional username and password logins in the web browser.

**How Secure is TraitWare Authentication?**
TraitWare uses Multi-Factor Authentication to secure each individual client's browser login to WordPress.  The factors that it utilizes for securing each user's identity are 1) each user's mobile device equipped with the TraitWare Mobile App, 2) the cloud-hosted TraitWare Authentication Server, 3) something you are or know.  While TraitWare's authentication is incredibly effective against malicious attacks and identity theft in a browser, site admins and their users should still use best practices. This means disabling username and password options and making sure ftp, sftp, and MySQL logins are complex.

**TraitWare Services Trial Period**
While the WordPress plugin is completely free to install and regsiter, if you wish to continue using the TraitWare app to sign in after your 30-day trial expires, you will be asked to choose a <a href="https://traitware.com/pricing/">payment plan</a> or remove the TraitWare plugin.

**TraitWare SSO User Portal**
TraitWare offers a User Portal to manage all of your site logins from one place. A site manager will sign in once, and have access to all sites on the account for the entire workday.
1. Navigate to login.traitware.com and select Log In With TraitWare
2. Open your TraitWare Mobile App and authenticate
3. Scan the QR to gain access to your sites
4. Thatâ€™s it!

**TraitWare Direct Login**
TraitWare offers direct login to the dashboard directly from the TraitWare app on your device. 
1. Open your TraitWare Mobile App and authenticate
2. Select Direct Login on the screen
3. Choose the site where you want to access the dashboard
4. That's it!

**TraitWare Restricted Content**
TraitWare offers to protect pages or sections of pages on top of securing logins for admins and consumers.

The following are links for the setup of the TraitWare plugin. Most of these steps can only be completed by the *Account Owner* (the initial administrator who sets up the TraitWare plugin or additional users added after) with limited actions which can be completed by a *Dashboard User* with a WordPress Administrator role.

= Firewalls =
If you have a plugin for firewalls (such as WordFence, All In One WP Security, etc), please make sure that you are allowing access to https://api.traitware.com or your IP. 

If you have Sucuri, your network IP will need to be whitelisted in order to access the plugin. Your network IP can most easily be found by navigating to speedtest.net. The IP will be listed at the bottom left, beneath your internet provider. If you are working on an Intranet, you may need to contact your IT department to allow the TraitWare plugin to communicate back and forth with https://api.traitware.com.

In some cases, a dedicated IP may be required to allow access to TraitWare.

= The QR image isn't loading, how can I scan it? =
First, make sure that you have clicked the button to show the QR. If the image of the QR code is still not showing, make sure that you have an internet connection and that you do not have a firewall blocking access to TraitWare. You may need to allow https://api.traitware.com or your IP to communicate with TraitWare.

= Additional Firewall and access fixes for a QR not loading =
If you have a plugin for firewalls (such as WordFence, All In One WP Security, etc), please make sure that you are allowing access to https://api.traitware.com or your IP. 

If you have Sucuri, your network IP will need to be whitelisted in order to access the plugin. Your network IP can most easily be found by navigating to speedtest.net. The IP will be listed at the bottom left, beneath your internet provider. If you are working on an Intranet, you may need to contact your IT department to allow the TraitWare plugin to communicate back and forth with https://api.traitware.com.

In some cases, a dedicated IP may be required to allow access to TraitWare.

You may also need to check that your .htaccess whiteliting is allowing access to all TraitWare Plugin files.

= I'm getting an error message when trying to send myself the registration email. What is the error? =
There a couple of things this could be. Mostly commonly, the error is because your WordPress version is below the required version of 3.7.0. If you have a version above that and still get an error, please make sure you have an internet connection. The last option is to make sure that your version of the TraitWare plugin is the most recent. Our updates are there to improve the plugin and the user experience as much as possible. If none of these solve your problem, please contact us at support@traitware.com or in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/traitware-login-manager">support forums</a>.

= How do I get the TraitWare App? =
The most effective way to get the TraitWare app onto your mobile device is to open your TraitWare registration email directly on your device and click the Register button. This will take you to your app store to download and register the app. Alternatively, you can search "traitware" directly from the app store on that device. Please not that due to changes to Apple products, it is not possible to add the app from a computer or laptop. If you have an Android device, you can still add the application from a computer or laptop as long as you are signed into the same Google account that is linked to your device.

= I lost my phone and cannot access my site, how can I get in? =
As an Account Owner, if you navigate to yoursite.com/login and select \"trouble?\", you can receive a secured email with a link to enter your username and password. If you are a user, please contact your site admin to resend your registration code.

= How many Account Owners can I have on my site? =
As many as you want. But remember, if you are giving people that responsibility, they can make any changes they want to TraitWare users. An Account Owner will also automatically be added to any WordPress sites that are on the account, so if you wish to only have a user administrate on a single site, make sure their role is "Administrator" and add them as a TraitWare Dashboard User. Dashboard Users will not be able to make changes to an Account Owner for security reasons.

= What is the difference between a "Site User and a Dashboard User?" =
A Site User is someone who won't be making modifications in the Dashboard(wp-admin). This is typically a subscriber or someone with their own page through custom login. It also includes users who need access to a protected resource. A Dashboard User will include the people who are working on the site itself, such as Administrators, Editors, Authors, etc. A Dashboard User who is also a WordPress Administrator will be able to complete most actions available in the TraitWare Plugin. 

= What is a Protected Page/Resource? =
A Protected Page/Resource is a page or an element on a page on a website that you have protected with the plugin. A user who is not given access to the resource will see a QR which they can scan using their TraitWare app to gain access to as long as the administrator has given them access to do so.

= Why would I want to remove the username and password fields? =
TraitWare takes pride in the fact that we are removing the option for you and your users to be hacked through a password in a browser. We have replaced this with a secured app on your phone instead. If you choose to leave those fields, just be aware that you are not as secured as you could be.

= How long can I try TraitWare before paying? =
TraitWare offers a free 30-day trial. If you don't love it after 30 days, simply deactivate the plugin. If you aren't sure yet about which plan works best for you, deactivating will save your account information on the TraitWare server. At the end of the 30-day trial, your account will be switched to a 30 day billing cycle. You will be charged based on your usage at the end of those 30 days. 

= What if I need to be issued a refund? =
If you feel that you have been wrongly charged, please contact support@traitware.com to clarify charges or get your refund process started.

= I'm getting an error on the QR when I try to login. How can I fix this? =
It's possible that your browser's cache needs to be cleared. We have noticed issues with Safari in particular caching old data and preventing the QR from loading properly. If this does not solve your issue, please contact us at support@tratiware.com.

= When I disable the login form, I don't see the QR to sign in. =
Any versions of the plugin up through 1.5.0 that are being used in parallel to JetPack with the WordPress.com log in activated will not be able to take advantage of the feature to disable the login form. A fix has been applied to 1.6.0-beta and beyond.

= What is a beta release? =
A beta release is new/updated features of a product which are being released to the public for further testing and fixes. This type of release allows for a company to get feedback from customers and improve as many of the existing changes as possible to make it as seamless to use for the customer as possible.

= The Registration Button in the email did not do anything for me, what went wrong? =
If you have an Android device, please make sure that your Google Play store is enabled. If you have an iOS product, please contact us at support@traitware.com.
